The goal of the workshop was to understand the basic features of the tool and create in one day a responsive visualization using <a href=\"http://ai2html.org/\" target=\"_blank\">ai2html</a>, a very cool open-source script for Adobe Illustrator that converts your Illustrator documents into html and css done by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/archietse\" target=\"_blank\">Archie Tse</a>, deputy graphics editor at The New York Times.</p>\n<p>The participants explored different open datasets and decided how to design a visualization for 3 different breakpoints (desktop, tablet and smartphone).Here you can see an example of a responsive visualization done during the workshop.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/42be9f8b71372607c562cfde0515de19/small.gif\"></p>\n  <p id=\"caption-attachment-778\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">\n    Work done by <a href=\"http://www.tizianaalocci.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Tiziana Alocci</a>.
