With “improved version” we mean a totally new software, rebuilt and redesigned starting from the feedback we received during all these years.</p>\n<p>A lot of people are asking us: “Why are you asking for donations? If the tool is used by many users why don’t you charge them? What about a freemium version?”</p>\n<p>It’s a recurrent discussion among us and here is a list of reasons why RAWGraphs will always be free (and open) and why we decided to launch a crowdfunding campaign:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>As designers and/or developers dealing with data visualization, <strong>we have to acknowledge the fact that our work would certainly be much different if many free and open source solutions didn't exist.</strong> We think about many existing projects like <a href=\"https://gephi.org/\">Gephi</a>, <a href=\"http://openrefine.org/\">Open Refine</a>, <a href=\"https://d3js.org/\">D3js</a> or <a href=\"https://scriptographer.org/\">Scriptographer</a> (R.I.P), which we were able to use for free and that shaped our processes and our skills. <strong>We wanted to pay back our contribution</strong> making people able to play with visualization and develop their data-literacy for free, or at least without the need to pay on a regular basis.</li>\n<li>The RAWGraphs team members work full time as researchers, professors, designers and developers. Some are involved in academic work, while others are successfully managing independent design and development studios. <strong>RAWGraphs has always been a side project and we are happy to keep as it is. We use it in our projects and during teaching activities and we are not interested in transform RAWGraphs our core project.</strong> Still, <strong>we need the resources to seriously dedicate time to it</strong> and to improve what we have. We think donations are the best way to achieve this goal.</li>\n<li>Transforming RAWGraphs in a paid software would mean scaling up the project and dedicate a lot of time (and money) on other activities, such as managing users/clients, payments, client support, business development, etc. <strong>Since we would like to keep it as minimal and lightweighted as possible, we prefer to use all the resources working on core features, rather than defining strategies to make money out of it.</strong> We are probably better designers than entrepreneurs.</li>\n<li><strong>RAWGraphs is mainly meant for producing raw visualisations</strong>, that still needs some graphical attuning. There are already many software allowing you to create well designed viz, ready for publication. These softwares (such as <a href=\"https://www.datawrapper.de/\">Datawrapper</a>, <a href=\"https://flourish.studio/\">Flourish</a>, the all-in-one <a href=\"https://www.tableau.com/\">Tableau</a> and many others) are doing great. We love and use them, and we are not interested in making a clone of them.</li>\n<li>Our users like RAWGraphs ALSO because is free. <strong>Being free and open, makes it easier for students, teachers and researchers to use them in courses, MOOC and workshops.</strong> We thought that an occasional payment would suit better this kind of usage rather than licenses or subscriptions.</li>\n<li>RAWGraphs was born inside a public university (<a href=\"http://www.design.polimi.it/en/\">Politecnico di Milano</a>) and <strong>we like the idea that something born in a public institution stays free for everyone.</strong></li>\n</ol>","snippet":"<html><head></head><body><p>As you may know, we have launched a crowdfunding campaign for RAWGraphs 2.0, an improved version of the tool we initially developed in 2013.

If you are interested in the technical details, <strong>we will update the GitHub page as soon as we will start the new implementation</strong>. But for all the other users, what does this mean, and why should you put your money in it?</p>\n<p><strong>Updating the technological stack is of fundamental importance to keep the project alive</strong>. Many of the technologies we used are now (almost) dead or deprecated, and the latest ones were not available when we wrote the “core” of the app. Due to these reasons we cannot expand the project in its current implementation.\nBuilding the new core <strong>will also allow us to add some long-awaited features</strong>, and the first step of the project will include:</p>\n<p><strong>New charts</strong>: of course this is what we all want. Backers will be able to choose three visual models that will be added to the current set.</p>\n<p><strong>Save and load configurations</strong>: it’s frustrating and time consuming to tweak all the parameters every time you want to make a new chart, in particular when you have to update it periodically and/or you have to produce a large number of them. In the new version it will be possible to save pre-set configurations (size, colors, fonts, etc) either by downloading a file that can be loaded in a latter moment or within your browser local-storage (a cookie). You will be able to decide if you want your data to stay attached to the configuration you download, resulting in a file that you can open and rework later on RAWGraphs.</p>\n<p><strong>More control and refinements</strong>: we always said that our goal is to make a tool to produce visualizations that can be further modified. We will continue to follow this philosophy, but there is still room to improve the basic layouts in order to be more refined, and add new parameters to customize the visualization directly in the app. We will also add the ability to export legends and to add annotations over the visualization.</p>\n<p><strong>Simplify the creation and the reuse of new visual models</strong>. Up to now, it was already possible to add new charts, but many users did for their own use and even if we received several code donations from users we were not able to add them to publicly available app for several reasons. In fact, proposed models were at times too specific, or they needed code revisions. In the new version, we want to make easier both the development of new visual models and, more relevant, the usage of them by the rest of the people.</p>\n<p><strong>Increased performance</strong>: of course more data, less lags, less crashes, resulting in a faster and more stable application for your everyday use.</p>\n<p>The development of the new core will also allow us to improve a couple of things that we think are valuable:</p>\n<p><strong>Confidentiality of your data</strong>. The data will never be sent to other computers, it will be used locally on your computer.\n<strong>Open visualizations</strong>. We want to keep visualization open not only from the technological point of view but also from the practical one: we want to avoid intended or unintended lock-ins and produce artefacts that can be exported, modified and reused with any other software.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-if-we-overpass-the-33000-euro-goal\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#what-if-we-overpass-the-33000-euro-goal\" aria-label=\"what if we overpass the 33000 euro goal permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>What if we overpass the 33,000 euro goal?</h2>\n<p>Well, here comes the magic! Again, we will have to thank and hug you all, but stronger &#x3C;3</p>\n<p>Only after that, we planned some stretch goals that we will cover according to the amount of funding we will collect.</p>\n<p><strong>Even more chart</strong>: More the funds, more the charts. How do we define which one? With a pool among backers, of course!</p>\n<p><strong>Stand-alone version</strong>: When you are dealing with really confidential data would be better to work completely offline. For this reason, we want to produce an offline stand-alone app that you can use without an internet connection.</p>\n<p><strong>Cross-browser compatibility</strong>: would be nice to use RAWGraphs also on Safari and Edge. We want to produce an app with the widest support among all browsers.</p>\n<p><strong>Export HTML bundles</strong>. SVGs are nice, but what about having the possibility to embed the code in a different web project? Our plans include allowing to download your visualizations as web packages (HTML + JS + CSS) that you can directly host on your website, and modify and customise it!</p>\n<p><strong>Interactive charts</strong>: When it is possible to export bundles, why not to add some interactivity? The new core will enable the creation and the export of interactive charts. Tooltips, filters, highlights... and many other ✨ details.</p>\n<p><strong>Export to online platform (e.g. Github pages, gist…)</strong>: another step will be the ability to export directly on online repositories to make even more simple their embedding and sharing online.</p>\n<p><strong>Help us make it possible by spreading the word about the campaign through social media and within your network.</strong>\nVisit our <a href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/rawgraphs-2-0/coming_soon/x/20662697\">pre-launch campaign page on Indiegogo</a> and subscribe.</p>","snippet":"<html><head></head><body><p>Up to now we told you that we are planning a campaign for RAWGraphs, but probably you’re wondering what we want to do, or in other words, what will change in RAWGraphs.</p> <p>We have in mind <strong>two steps for the project</strong>, and the amount of things will depend obviously from the funding we will get.</p> <p>Let us anticipate that we’d love <strong>to know what you think</strong> and if you find there are some missing <strong>features that you’d like to…</strong></p></body></html>","excerpt":"Up to now we told you that we are planning a campaign for RAWGraphs, but probably you’re wondering what we want to do, or in other words…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Inmagik joins the RAWGraphs team","path":"/rawgraphs-team/inmagik-joins-the-rawgraphs-team/","date":"August 20th, 2019","categories":["RAWGraphs Team"],"author":"RAW Graphs Team","image":{"publicURL":"/static/8bfc4b4272e6da7d1aef56edd72fffa8/inmagik_rawgraphs.png"}},"html":"<p>If you followed us on social media, when we announced the launch of a <a href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/rawgraphs-2-0/coming_soon\">crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo</a>, we also shared other news: <strong>Inmagik is becoming part of the RAWGraphs team!</strong></p>\n<p>Inmagik is a studio based in Bergamo (Italy), focused on the development of web applications, mobile apps, data management systems and interactive user experiences.\nInmagik solutions are based on two strong foundations: web standards and open source tools, and their core business is building applications with popular frameworks and libraries like django (python) and react (javascript), with experiences in data visualization, technical web interfaces (medical/industrial) and geographical data management.</p>\n<p>We were lucky enough to meet Mauro Bianchi, the founder of Inmagik, a few years ago, when he was involved in academic projects with DensityDesign.

But now, we have some exciting news to share.</p>\n<p>As we’ve previously discussed on <a href=\"https://datastori.es/91-visualizing-data-with-raw/\">Datastories</a>, RAWGraphs was born as a self-initiated side project more than 6 years ago in an academic context during our work at the DensityDesign Research Lab at Politecnico di Milano, mostly thanks to the work of Giorgio Caviglia who lead the project in the initial years.</p>\n<p>Apart from some sponsorships, we always worked on maintaining and improving RAWGraphs during our spare time and for free, we added charts and features according to our needs and user feedback as we went along, without a specific roadmap. We did some experiments but we were always too busy with other professional, teaching and research activities, and did not get the chance to finalize them and make them accessible to everyone.</p>\n<p>We got to a point where we realized that if we wanted to keep working on RAWGraphs and improve it, we needed to invest more time and energy into it. Especially because, what was born as a self-initiated project, has now become an important tool for professionals and teachers around the world (we have more than 4,000 unique visitors every week).</p>\n<p>This is why we decided it was time to find a sustainable way to maintain the project. The goal is to fairly compensate the people that work on the project, enlarge the team and dedicate the right amount of time and resources on it.</p>\n<p>In order to accomplish this, we’re launching a crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo after the summer to raise funds to support the design and development of a brand new version of RAWGraphs. We went for the crowdfunding option because we thought it was an interesting way to get in touch with our users while continuing to be independent.\nThe most important thing for us is to keep the tool <strong>100% free and open to everyone</strong>, staying true to the original spirit of the project.</p>\n<p>In the coming weeks we will write more details about the campaign, the perks, the features we are planning to implement and our goals for the campaign.</p>\n<p><strong>Help us make it possible by spreading the word about the campaign through social media and within your network.</strong>\nVisit our <a href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/rawgraphs-2-0/coming_soon/x/20662697\">pre-launch campaign page on Indiegogo</a> and subscribe.</p>","snippet":"<html><head></head><body><p>It has been a while since we last wrote a post on this blog.
