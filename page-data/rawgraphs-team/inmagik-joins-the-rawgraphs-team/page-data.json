Since then we have been collaborating with him and the Inmagik team on several projects (such as <a href=\"https://ww1.lu/\">Ã‰ischte Weltkrich</a>).</p>\n<p>Since we are now entering a new phase for RAWGraphs, we thought we would enlarge our team and involve a more experienced partner in the development of robust and open source software.</p>\n<p>Inmagik was our natural choice because of their experience and their alignment with the original spirit of RAWGraphs.</p>\n<p>If you want to know more about them, visit their website: <a href=\"https://inmagik.com/en/\">inmagik.com</a>.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"August 20th, 2019","path":"/rawgraphs-team/inmagik-joins-the-rawgraphs-team/","title":"Inmagik joins the RAWGraphs team","author":"RAW Graphs Team","categories":["RAWGraphs Team"],"tags":["crowdfunding","support","partnership"],"widgets":null,"image":{"publicURL":"/static/8bfc4b4272e6da7d1aef56edd72fffa8/inmagik_rawgraphs.png"}}}},"pageContext":{}}}
