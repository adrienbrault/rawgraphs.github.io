We have completely refactored the software from the core to the front end.\nA lot of effort has been put into how the data is parsed and how the charts are built. Another important feature that has been added is the possibility to export projects (data, mapping, and options) to improve the way you use RAWGraphs.</p>\n<p>We are currently working on adding more charts and control over labels and charts options. Follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rawgraphs\">Twitter</a> for sneak peeks of the new features.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"can-i-still-contribute-to-the-crowdfunding-campaign\"><a href=\"#can-i-still-contribute-to-the-crowdfunding-campaign\" aria-label=\"can i still contribute to the crowdfunding campaign permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Can I still contribute to the crowdfunding campaign?</h2>\n<p>After we reached the goal of our <a href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/rawgraphs-2-0-a-web-app-for-data-visualization#/\">campaign</a>, we decided to keep the Indiegogo page open to donations. You have been very generous and we can't thank you enough for it.</p>\n<p>But everything comes to an end and we will close the <a href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/rawgraphs-2-0-a-web-app-for-data-visualization#/\">Indiegogo campaign</a> on the 15th of January. We will use every cent to improve the app and dedicate time to the project. <strong>So don't be shy, if you use RAWGraphs for your work consider donating, even with a small amount. You still have time</strong>.</p>\n<p>From the next year, we will consider other ways to financially support the project and keep it sustainable.

For these reasons we have decided to offer remote sessions and we will contact all the participants in the coming weeks to accommodate everyone's needs. We are planning more sessions to have smaller groups to ease participation and support.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"January 4th, 2021","path":"/crowdfunding-campaign/rawgraphs2-updates-and-release/","title":"RAWGraphs 2.0 updates and release","author":"RAW Graphs Team","categories":["RAWGraphs 2.0","Early Access"],"tags":["RAWGraphs 2.0","update","Early Access"],"widgets":null,"image":{"publicURL":"/static/rawgraps-2-9b088288e58b0216041a76ab3adf4d85.png"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
