More data is being generated than ever before. By the year 2020, about 1.7 megabytes of new data will be created every second for each human being on the planet. The difficulty of mining data to produce actionable insights is turning businesses towards the developing field of data visualization.

&nbsp;

Fast growing engagement-marketing platform <a href="http://contactlab.com/en/" target="_blank">Contactlab</a>, announces the sponsorship of RAWGraphs, a top data visualization web app built by <a href="http://www.densitydesign.org/" target="_blank">DensityDesign</a>, a research lab of the Politecnico di Milano university, and by <a href="http://calib.ro/" target="_blank">Calibro</a>, in recognition of the growing importance of visualizations in brand marketing strategies. Mapping out the data in different ways allows brands to explore patterns and trends to make more informed business decisions.

&nbsp;

RAWGraphs is an open source data web app built to make complex data easy to understand. RAWGraphs provides the missing link between spreadsheet applications and vector graphics editors.

&nbsp;

Luca Olivari, Chief Data Officer of Contactlab comments:

“The Data visualization initiative aims to help companies, researchers and scholars to build solid arguments and unveil the hidden connections of complex systems through data using innovative and engaging interfaces. Visualizing complex data requires an ecosystem of partners working together with leading research institutions. The cooperation between DensityDesign, Calibro and Contactlab aims to accelerate product development and build an active community of data visualization.”

&nbsp;

Paolo Ciuccarelli of DensityDesign, Politecnico di Milano university, comments:

“our mission as a research lab is to steer the public culture of data and information. Building partnerships to support the development of open, accessible and usable tools to transform data into visual artifacts is definitely one of the main pillars of our strategy.”

&nbsp;

Main features of the new product release include the change to <a href="https://github.com/densitydesign/raw#license" target="_blank">Apache 2 License</a> to foster cooperation with a broader community; an updated technology stack and the availability of new charts and visualizations. RAWGraphs will take advantage of a completely new website and a blog open to the developer’s community.
