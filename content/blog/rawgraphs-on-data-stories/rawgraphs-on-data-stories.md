Last week we have been interviewed for the [episode n°91](http://datastori.es/91-visualizing-data-with-raw/) of [Data Stories](http://datastori.es/), a podcast on data visualization with [Enrico Bertini](http://enrico.bertini.io/) and [Moritz Stefaner](http://truth-and-beauty.net/).

&nbsp;

During the episode we talked about how we decided to develop RAWGraphs, how we got started, some &#8220;geeky stuff&#8221; about the project, the lessons we&#8217;ve learned, and our future plans.

&nbsp;

We want to thank the [Data Stories team](http://datastori.es/team/) for the possibility and we invite our user to [support](https://www.patreon.com/datastories) the show by becoming a Data Stories patron. Backing starts at $3 per episode.
