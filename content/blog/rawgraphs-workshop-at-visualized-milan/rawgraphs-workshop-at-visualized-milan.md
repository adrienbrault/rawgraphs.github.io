After Berlin and London, the third European <a href="http://visualized.com/milan/" target="_blank">Visualized</a> chapter came to Milan last week-end for an inspiring and educational one-day conference.

We have been invited by the Visualized team to organize an intensive one day workshop the day before the conference to teach how to use RAWGraphs to a group of 20 participants. The goal of the workshop was to understand the basic features of the tool and create in one day a responsive visualization using <a href="http://ai2html.org/" target="_blank">ai2html</a>, a very cool open-source script for Adobe Illustrator that converts your Illustrator documents into html and css done by <a href="https://twitter.com/archietse" target="_blank">Archie Tse</a>, deputy graphics editor at The New York Times.

The participants explored different open datasets and decided how to design a visualization for 3 different breakpoints (desktop, tablet and smartphone).Here you can see an example of a responsive visualization done during the workshop.

If you are interested in organizing a workshop about RAWGraphs feel free to contact us at <hello@rawgraphs.io>. They are important moments for us to understand how people use the tool and understand how to improve the project.

Thanks again to <a href="http://www.inarea.com/" target="_blank">Inarea</a> for hosting the workshop in their Milan offices.
