Do you use RAWGraphs for your teaching activities? Do you want to give us more feedback for the development or RAWGraphs 2.0?

We are very glad to announce that today we launch a special program for educators who want to have early access to the new version of RAWGraphs for their courses. We think that teachers and students can provide very useful insights about the tool and we want to include them in the process as early as possible.

## Who can participate?
The program is open to teachers and instructors of **public schools and universities** around the world.

RAWGraphs was born inside a public university (Politecnico di Milano) and we like to support public education in every possible way. Other type of teaching activities, such as courses for NGOs and community organizations, will be taken in considerations as well.

## How to participate?
To take part in the program is very easy. You have to contact us at [hello@rawgraphs.io](mailto:hello@rawgraphs.io) and provide the following information:
- A link or a document that proves you are a teacher or instructor of a **public** school or university.
- A brief description and duration of the course.
- A description of how you use RAWGraphs in your teaching activities.

Once you will receive the credentials for you class, we will ask you to share feedback about this new version of RAWGraphs. An ad hoc form will be shared with you to collect information and insights from you and your students.
