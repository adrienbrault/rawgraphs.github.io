On October 1st we launched a campaign to raise funds to develop and design a brand new version of RAWGraphs. We didn't know what to expect from it and to be honest. After more than 60 days of campaigning, we can finally say that we made it!

Total amount raised from October 1st until today.

We received more than 350 donations from 40 countries and, since we reached the goal, our campaign is still active on Indiegogo as "In Demand". You can still contribute and share the campaign within your network.

A special thanks go to our sponsor that generously supported our campaign:

We would like to thank everyone who supported us on Indiegogo (we will soon add a page on our website where we will display all the names of the backers) and spread the word on social media. We were surprised by the beautiful messages we have received in these past weeks and by the incredible support we have received by the data viz community and beyond.

What about the next steps? We are now planning the next first phases of the project and we will soon share with you more information about the roadmap towards RAWGraphs 2.0. You won't be disappointed!
