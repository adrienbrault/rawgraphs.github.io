Today is the big day!

One year after the end of a successful crowdfunding campaign, and few months after the release of the beta version to our sponsors and supporters, we are very excited to publicly release the first version of RAWGraphs 2.0 to everyone.

You can enjoy it [here](https://app.rawgraphs.io/) and check the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rawgraphs/rawgraphs-app) of the new version.

In the coming days and weeks we will continue the development of new charts and will prepare more documentation to learn how to use and customize the tool.

If you want to still use the previous version of RAWGraphs, you can access it [here](https://old.rawgraphs.io/).

If you are a sponsor or a supporter who donated more than 50â‚¬ to our campaign, you will be able to still use the private early version. New charts and new versions will be first tested there.

Stay tuned for more updates!
