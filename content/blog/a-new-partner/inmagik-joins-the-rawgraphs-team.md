If you followed us on social media, when we announced the launch of a [crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/rawgraphs-2-0/coming_soon), we also shared other news: **Inmagik is becoming part of the RAWGraphs team!**

Inmagik is a studio based in Bergamo (Italy), focused on the development of web applications, mobile apps, data management systems and interactive user experiences.
Inmagik solutions are based on two strong foundations: web standards and open source tools, and their core business is building applications with popular frameworks and libraries like django (python) and react (javascript), with experiences in data visualization, technical web interfaces (medical/industrial) and geographical data management.

We were lucky enough to meet Mauro Bianchi, the founder of Inmagik, a few years ago, when he was involved in academic projects with DensityDesign. Since then we have been collaborating with him and the Inmagik team on several projects (such as [Ã‰ischte Weltkrich](https://ww1.lu/)).

Since we are now entering a new phase for RAWGraphs, we thought we would enlarge our team and involve a more experienced partner in the development of robust and open source software.

Inmagik was our natural choice because of their experience and their alignment with the original spirit of RAWGraphs.
