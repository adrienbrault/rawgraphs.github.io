The [Data Visualization Society](https://www.datavisualizationsociety.com/) (DVS) was born in Feb 2019. We use Slack as our communicative hub with over 60 channels. This visualization illustrates our activity over the past month and a half, between Feb 2 to Apr 7/2019 &#8211; responses vs. emotional reactions of the varied channels.
