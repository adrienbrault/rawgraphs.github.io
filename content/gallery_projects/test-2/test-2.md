  There are an estimated 168 million children in child labour across the world today. More than half of them, 85 million, are in hazardous work. There are also at least 21 million people, both children and adults, working in forced labour, a modern form of slavery. Many work in the production of everyday goods, from food and drinks, clothes and footwear, to electronics, toys, carpets, or building materials. Forced or child labour being used in 74 countries across the world to produce 136 goods. Aiming to visualise each product of slavery and child labour per continent and  country, the cluster dendrogram allowed me to  categorise all the information in an organised, clear view.
