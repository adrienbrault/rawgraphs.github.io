How is a royal agenda structured and how many appointments does the queen of England attend every month? Â Queen Elizabeth II seems to have had quite a busy 2016, with a total of 388 tasks parted between political, religious, diplomatic and representative activities. The visualisation explores all the appointments attended month by month, focusing on the type of task and the locations visited by her Majesty during the last year. Published on La Lettura.
