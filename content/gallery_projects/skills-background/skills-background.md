  The streamgraphÂ allows, in few time and space, to visually communicate 20 years of works and skills evolution. I like its organic shape that better fits the purpose of the visualisation, evoking the evolution of a creative flow, too. Then I added a little bit of interactivity with jQuery, in order to transform its exploration in a mini engaging experience.
