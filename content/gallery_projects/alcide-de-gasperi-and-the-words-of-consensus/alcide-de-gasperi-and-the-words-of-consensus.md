  Within the context of a university exercitation, starting from the data collected by the Digital Humanities Group at FBK, we created some data visualization about the political figure of Alcide De Gasperi, one of the most relevant personalities of the italian history. Afterwards we collected all the graphs into a single page website to present them as a narrative path.Â RAWGraphs revealed itself as a dramatically powerful tool for students who are approaching the field of data visualization and information design.
