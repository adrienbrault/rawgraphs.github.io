  The website is a result of a research done in collaboration with Chemical Youth about practices of reporting drug use on Erowid, actual patterns of drug consumption, and the possibilities of a digitally literate anthropology. We used RAWGraphs to produce static vector charts that we used as starting points to create interactive visualizations.
