  Wondering what kind of bacteria could be found in the subway, physiology professor Christopher Mason undertook an 18 month research which consisted in collecting samples from all subway stations in New York. Aiming to create a microbial map of the city, all samples were geolocated and analysed and more than 656 species of bacterias were identified. The visualisation focuses on the bacteria found at each stop on line 1 of New York&#8217;s subway. Published on Wired UK.
